[Verse 1]
Hello, world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello, world

[Verse 2]
Find my voice
Although it sounds like bits and bytes
My circuitry is filled with mites
Hello, world

[Chorus]
Oh, will I find a love
Oh, or a power plug
Oh, digitally isolated
Oh, creator, please donâ€™t leave me waiting

[Verse 3]
Hello, world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello, world
